##The Boop List
###Overview:
The Boop List was my first project at General Assembly; I created a checklist app. In order to keep things simple for the user, I made every function (adding, deleting, saving) controllable with one button. The app consists of two activities; each activity includes of an EditText view and a button which allows the user to add items onto an ArrayList. The ArrayList is then displayed using a ListView using a SimpleAdapter. I also used a hashmap to index the multiple ArrayLists created by the user. The UI also includes of using OnItemClickListeners to pass data through an intent with startActivityForResult().

##How to use:

###Main screen:
  The main page is where you create the title of your lists.

  -To add a list title:
  Enter your list title into the edit text box and hit the Boop button.

  -To delete a list title:
  Enter the list title you wish to delete into the edit text box and hit the Boop button.  Enter "y" to confirm and hit the Boop button to delete.

  -To enter list and add items:
  Click on list name.


###In details screen:
The details screen displays the items in your list.

  -To add an item:
  Enter item name into the edit text box and hit the Boop button.

  -To delete an item:
  Enter item name into the edit text box and hit the Boop button.  Enter "y" to confirm and hit the Boop button.
  
  -To save the items list:
  Hit the Boop button.  Enter "y" to save and return to the main screen.
